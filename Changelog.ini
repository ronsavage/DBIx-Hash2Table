[V 2.01]
Date=2005-10-27T19:40:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Simplify code in new() to no longer check if caller is an object
as per the new standard on such matters
- Regenerate META.yml with Module::Build V 0.2611 to correct a faulty
META.yml output by V 0.24 which falsely said 'provides: {}'
which in turn stopped the PAUSE indexer from finding the module file
which in turn meant this module might be omitted from the master index:

[V 2.00]
Date=2004-07-19T14:43:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Change the API so that the constructor's parameter 'columns' no longer does
double duty. Now instead of a single parameter 'columns' you use 2 parameters:
'columns' and 'extras'. The new parameter 'columns' takes exactly the same 3
values as did the old parameter of the same name and any other values which you
previously had to put in sorted order at the end of the old parameter 'columns'
can now be placed in any unsorted order in the new parameter 'extras'. The API
should have always been like this - the previous design was very confusing.
Since no new functionality has been introduced in V 2.00 there is no need to
upgrade unless compatibility with Module::Build is important (see next point)
- Change Makefile.PL to coexist with Module::Build
- Rewrite the docs to help clarify the structure of the hash ref which is saved to
the database
- Patch examples/test-hashref2table.pl to match the new API
- Delete ./test.pl
- Add t/pod.t to test all PODs

[V 1.03]
Date=2003-03-23T11:29:00
Comments= <<EOT
- No source code changes in this version
- Patch to stop shipping blib/ directory in Unix distros because the
PAUSE indexer takes this directory to indicate a binary distro
which means it does not index the module and this in turn means
the module is not listed in the CPAN daily update list etc.

[V 1.02]
Date=2003-01-26T10:43:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Fix bug for where user specifies more than 1 'extra' column in the 'columns' parameter
- Add extra columns to the table created by examples/test-hash2table.pl in
preparation for using the same table with the demo for DBIx::Table2Hash
- Extend test-hash2table.pl to read back in and print the table created
- Update docs
