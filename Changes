Revision history for Perl extension DBIx::Hash2Table.

2.04  Sun Feb 21 12:55:02 2010
	- Remove text 'All rights reserved' (for Debian licensing).
	- Remove POD heads 'Required Modules' and 'Changes'.

2.03  Wed Feb 10 14:01:51 2010
	- MANIFEST.SKIP updated to exclude MYMETA.yml. Add MYMETA.yml.

2.02  Fri Nov 13 13:20:00 2009
	- Run dos2unix
	- Rename Changes.txt to CHANGES

2.01  Thu Oct 27 19:40:00 2005
	- Simplify code in new() to no longer check if caller is an object
		as per the new standard on such matters
	- Regenerate META.yml with Module::Build V 0.2611 to correct a faulty
		META.yml output by V 0.24 which falsely said 'provides: {}',
		which in turn stopped the PAUSE indexer from finding the module file,
		which in turn meant this module might be omitted from the master index:
		ftp://pause.perl.org/pub/PAUSE/modules/01modules.index.html

2.00  Mon Jul 19 14:43:00 2004
	- Change the API, so that the constructor's parameter 'columns' no longer does
		double duty. Now, instead of a single parameter 'columns', you use 2 parameters:
		'columns' and 'extras'. The new parameter 'columns' takes exactly the same 3
		values as did the old parameter of the same name, and any other values, which you
		previously had to put in sorted order at the end of the old parameter 'columns',
		can now be placed in any unsorted order in the new parameter 'extras'. The API
		should have always been like this - the previous design was very confusing.
		Since no new functionality has been introduced in V 2.00, there is no need to
		upgrade, unless compatibility with Module::Build is important (see next point)
	- Change Makefile.PL to coexist with Module::Build
	- Rewrite the docs to help clarify the structure of the hash ref which is saved to
		the database
	- Patch examples/test-hashref2table.pl to match the new API
	- Delete ./test.pl
	- Add t/pod.t to test all PODs

1.03  Sun Mar 23 11:29:00 2003
	- No source code changes in this version
	- Patch to stop shipping blib/ directory in Unix distros, because the
		PAUSE indexer takes this directory to indicate a binary distro,
		which means it does not index the module, and this in turn means
		the module is not listed in the CPAN daily update list, etc.

1.02  Sun Jan 26 10:43:00 2003
	- Fix bug for where user specifies more than 1 'extra' column in the 'columns' parameter
	- Add extra columns to the table created by examples/test-hash2table.pl, in
		preparation for using the same table with the demo for DBIx::Table2Hash
	- Extend test-hash2table.pl to read back in and print the table created
	- Update docs

1.01  Sat Jan 18 12:47:00 2003
	- Change use CGI to use Carp. Upgrading is advised

1.00  Wed Jan  8 12:37:29 2003
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.20 with options
		-A -X -f -n DBIx::Hash2Table -v 1.00
